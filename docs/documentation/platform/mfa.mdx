MFA requires users to provide multiple forms of identification to access their account. Currently, this means logging in with your password and a 6-digit code sent to your email.

## Email 2FA

Check the box in Personal Settings > Two-factor Authentication to enable email-based 2FA.

<Note>
  Infisical currently supports email-based 2FA. We're actively working on
  building support for other forms of identification via SMS and Authenticator
  App.
</Note>

## Entra ID / Azure AD MFA

<Note>
    Before proceeding make sure you've enabled [SAML SSO for Entra ID / Azure AD](./sso/azure).

    We also encourage you to have your team download and setup the
    [Microsoft Authenticator App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app) prior to enabling MFA.

        <Note>
            By default all users except the configuring admin will be setup to require MFA.
            Microsoft encourages keeping at least one admin excluded from MFA to prevent accidental lockout.
