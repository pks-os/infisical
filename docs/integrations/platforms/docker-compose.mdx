Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

## Configure the Infisical CLI for each service

Follow this [guide](./docker) to configure the Infisical CLI for each service that you wish to inject environment variables into; you'll have to update the Dockerfile of each service.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Machine Identity (Recommended)">
    ### Generate and configure machine identity
    Generate a machine identity for each service you want to inject secrets into. You can do this by following the steps in the [Machine Identity](/documentation/platform/identities/machine-identities) guide.

    ### Set the machine identity client ID and client secret as environment variables
    For each service you want to inject secrets into, set two environment variable called `INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`, and `INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET` equal to the client ID and client secret of the machine identity(s) you created in the previous step.

    In the example below, we set two sets of client ID and client secret for the services.

    For the web service we set `INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID_FOR_WEB` and `INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET_FOR_WEB` as the client ID and client secret respectively.

    For the API service we set `INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID_FOR_API` and `INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET_FOR_API` as the client ID and client secret respectively.

    ```yaml
    # Example Docker Compose file
    services:
      web:
        build: .
        image: example-service-1
        environment:
          - INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=${INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID_FOR_WEB}
          - INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET=${INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET_FOR_WEB}

      api:
        build: .
        image: example-service-2
        environment:
          - INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=${INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID_FOR_API}
          - INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET=${INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET_FOR_API}

    ```

    ### Export shell variables
    Next, set the shell variables you defined in your compose file. This can be done manually or via your CI/CD environment. Once done, it will be used to populate the corresponding `INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID` and `INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET` in your Docker Compose file.

    ```bash
    #Example

    # Token refers to the token we generated in step 2 for this service
    export INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID_FOR_WEB=<client_id>
    export INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET_FOR_WEB=<client_secret>

    # Token refers to the token we generated in step 2 for this service
    export INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID_FOR_API=<client_id>
    export INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET_FOR_API=<client_secret>

    # Then run your compose file in the same terminal.
    docker-compose ...
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Service Token">

    ## Generate service token
    Generate a unique [Service Token](/documentation/platform/token) for each service.

    ## Feed service token to your Docker Compose file

    For each service you want to inject secrets into, set an environment variable called `INFISICAL_TOKEN` equal to a unique identifier variable.

    In the example below, we set `INFISICAL_TOKEN_FOR_WEB` and `INFISICAL_TOKEN_FOR_API` as the `INFISICAL_TOKEN` for the services.

    ```yaml
    # Example Docker Compose file
    services:
      web:
        build: .
        image: example-service-1
        environment:
          - INFISICAL_TOKEN=${INFISICAL_TOKEN_FOR_WEB}

      api:
        build: .
        image: example-service-2
        environment:
          - INFISICAL_TOKEN=${INFISICAL_TOKEN_FOR_API}
    ```

    ## Export shell variables

    Next, set the shell variables you defined in your compose file. This can be done manually or via your CI/CD environment. Once done, it will be used to populate the corresponding `INFISICAL_TOKEN`
    in your Docker Compose file.

    ```bash
    #Example

    # Token refers to the token we generated in step 2 for this service
    export INFISICAL_TOKEN_FOR_WEB=<token>

    # Token refers to the token we generated in step 2 for this service
    export INFISICAL_TOKEN_FOR_API=<token>

    # Then run your compose file in the same terminal.
    docker-compose ...
    ```
