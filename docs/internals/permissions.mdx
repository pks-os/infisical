## Summary

The Infisical permissions system is based on a role-based access control (RBAC) model. The system allows you to define roles and assign them to users and machines. Each role has a set of permissions that define what actions a user can perform.

Permissions are built on a subject-action-object model. The subject is the resource permission is being applied to, the action is what the permission allows.
An example of a subject/action combination would be `secrets/read`. This permission allows the subject to read secrets.

Currently Infisical supports 4 actions:
1. `read`, allows the subject to read the object.
2. `create`, allows the subject to create the object.
3. `edit`, allows the subject to edit the object.
4. `delete`, allows the subject to delete the object.

Most subjects support all 4 actions, but some subjects only support a subset of actions. Please view the table below for a list of subjects and the actions they support.

  These details are especially useful if you're using the API to [create new project roles](../api-reference/endpoints/project-roles/create).
  The rules outlined on this page, also apply when using our Terraform Provider to manage your Infisical project roles, or any other of our clients that manage project roles.
